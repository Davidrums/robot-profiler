A Profiler for the Robot Framework.

Overview
--------
The Robot Profiler analysis the output.xml file generated
during test runs by the Robot Framework. It calculates
the overall runtime, the average runtime, and the number
of calls on a "per keyword" level. The calculated data
are written to a file for later use with a spreadsheet.
